LODWICK_UI Library Tutorial
In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use the LODWICK_UI library to underline words and perform word-based maths operations on your pages.

1. Including the LODWICK_UI Library
First, include the lodwick_ui.js file in your HTML page:


        <script src="lodwick_ui.js"></script>
    
2. Underlining Words
To underline specific words in an HTML element, you can use the LODWICK_UI() function with the desired element’s selector.

Here’s an example of underlining words and toggling their highlight on click:

HTML Code:

        <div id="demo2">
            Here we will test the word-based selection and manipulation.
        </div>
    
JavaScript Code:

        LODWICK_UI('#demo2', 'words').css('color', 'red').on('click', function() {
            let x = this;
            x.classList.toggle('highlight');
            // Underline word dynamically
            LODWICK_UI().underlineWord(x);
        });
    
Example:
Here we will test the word-based selection and manipulation.
3. Word Counting and Positioning
You can also use the LODWICK_UI.maths() function to count the number of repeated words and display their positions in a text.

Here’s how you can apply it:

HTML Code:

        <div id="demo3">
            We repeat words so that we are able to count the number of repeated words, words, words and the positions.
        </div>
        <div id="count">
            <!-- Count and position info will appear here -->
        </div>
    
JavaScript Code:

        LODWICK_UI.maths('#demo3');
    
Example:
We repeat words so that we are able to count the number of repeated words, words, words and the positions.
4. Final Full Example
Here’s a full example that combines everything:

HTML and JavaScript Code:

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <title>LODWICK_UI Maths and Underline Demo</title>
            <style>
                .highlight {
                    background-color: yellow;
                }
                .word {
                    cursor: pointer;
                }
            </style>
        </head>
        <body>
            <div id="demo">
                Here we will test the word-based selection and manipulation.
            </div>
            <div id="demo2">
                Here we will test the word-based selection and manipulation.
            </div>
            <div id="demo3">
                We repeat words so that we are able to count the number of repeated words, words, words and the positions.
            </div>
            <div id="count"></div>

            <script src="lodwick_ui.js"></script>
            <script>
                // Underlining words and adding click functionality
                LODWICK_UI('#demo2', 'words').css('color', 'red').on('click', function() {
                    let x = this;
                    x.classList.toggle('highlight');
                    LODWICK_UI().underlineWord(x);
                });

                // Counting word repetitions and positions
                LODWICK_UI.maths('#demo3');
            </script>
        </body>
        </html>
